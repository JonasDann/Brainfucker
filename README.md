brainfuck
=========

Brainfuck interpreter implemented in C

Linux:
To compile under linux you have to link it with the ncurses libary (gcc main_linux.c -lncurses) that has to be installed on the computer.

Windows:
To compile under windows just compile the main_windows.c. The windows version uses the standard conio.h header.

=========

The programm has one argument, that is the file which contains the brainfuck code to implement.

=========

Planned features:

 - Ook interpreter
 - Ook to brainfuck compiler and other way around
